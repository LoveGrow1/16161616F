        <h4>Celebrate Your 7th Year Milestone:</h4>
        <p>As you've been dating for 84 months, it's a perfect time to rekindle your physical connection. Plan a romantic getaway or even a simple date night at home. Show physical affection in ways you both are comfortable with. This act will not only reaffirm your love for one another but also can serve as an opportunity to discuss your physical needs and boundaries.</p>
